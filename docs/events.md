#Events 

The Events menu allows searching and visualising events and annotations performed in the different objects.

Different filters can be applied. For instance, searching for the plant 795 having the URI `m3p:/arch/2017/c17000795`, yields 4 different events, each one characterised by a `Type`, `Description`, `Concern` and a `Date of event`.

Detailed information of each event can be displayed including RDF triples:

Further annotations can be added by clicking on the Annotation button <span class="btn btn-warning">Add Annotation</span> 

Annotations are mainly guided by the OEEv ontology and the Web Annotation Data Model [(https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/)](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) that allows annotating any object declared in the system and assigning motivation and purpose attributes to annotations (e.g. oa:describing, oa:identifying, oa:linking, oa: replying, etc.)
